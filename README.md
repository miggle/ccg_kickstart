# CCG Kickstart install profile
The install profile for NHS CCGs to build sites with.

## Using the install profile
This install profile isn't currently managed by Drupal.org and so you won't be able to use drush to add it to your project.  
You can download a release of the project manually but we would recommend the following:

### With the packaged distribution
The best way to use the install profile is with the packaged distribution here: [https://github.com/miggle/ccg_kickstart_distro](https://github.com/miggle/ccg_kickstart_distro)  

### With composer
If you don't want to use the packaged distro you can add the profile as a dependency with composer:  
```composer require miggle/ccg_kickstart```
